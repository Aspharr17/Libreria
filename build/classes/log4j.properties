# An example log4j configuration file that directs its logging output
# to a SocketAppender. The SocketAppender is configuted to send its
# output to a server running on the localhost port number 12345.

# To test this example, you must start a log4j server with the command
#
#
#  java org.apache.log4j.net.SocketServer 12345 configurationFile directory/
#
#

# For the general syntax of property based configuration files see
# the documenation of org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.

# The root logger uses the appender called A1.
